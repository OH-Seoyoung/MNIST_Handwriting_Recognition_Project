# MNIST Handwriting Recognition Project
- Recognition of MNIST handwriting images
- Softmax Regression, CNN models
- Mar. 16, 2020 ~ Jun. 23, 2020

### Project for the 4th-grade 'Comprehensive Design' Course 
- Mathematics is very widely used in artificial intelligence research.
In this project, the goal is to learn mathematical concepts used in machine learning
and finally to build artificial intelligence models. 
Through this project, we will be able to discover another aspect of mathematics.  
- This project is maintained by 오서영, 이정, 조지수, 이지수 (Department of Mathematics)

## Process
1. Setting goals and creating plans  

2. Studying the basic of Neural Network - loss function, gradient descent, backpropagation, softmax, etc.  

3. Collecting the data and Planning the model  

4. Building a model with Python - Softmax Regression  

5. Analyzing Model Accuracy  

6. Studying the basic of CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) - Architecture, Size of output, #parameters  

7. Building a model with Python - CNN  

8. Analyzing Model Accuracy  

9. Test with 500 real Handwriting Data (50 people) | [Code](https://github.com/OH-Seoyoung/MNIST_Handwriting_Recognition_Project/blob/master/CNN_Model_Test.ipynb)  

10. Finalize report and presentation
