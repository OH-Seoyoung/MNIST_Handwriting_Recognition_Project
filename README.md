# MNIST_Handwriting_Recognition_Project (20200316~)
- Recognition of MNIST handwriting images
- Softmax Regression, CNN models

### Project for the 4th-grade 'Comprehensive Design' Course 
#### - 오서영, 이정, 조지수, 이지수 (Department of Mathematics)
- Mathematics is very widely used in artificial intelligence research.
In this project, the goal is to learn mathematical concepts used in machine learning
and finally to build artificial intelligence models. 
Through this project, we will be able to discover another aspect of mathematics.


## Project Process
- 1~2 weeks : Setting goals and creating plans
- 3~4 weeks : To study the basic of Neural Network - loss function, gradient descent, backpropagation, softmax, etc.
- 5 week : Collecting the data and Planning the model
- 6~7 weeks : Building a model with Python - Softmax Regression
- 8 week : Analyzing Model Accuracy

## Dataset
- MNIST Dataset : http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist
- Data input script : https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist

## Architecture
1. Softmax Regression
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Results - Train, Test Accuracy
1. Softmax Regression
    Train Accuracy : 91%, Test Accuracy : 91%
